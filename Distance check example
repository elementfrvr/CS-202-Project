In the distanceCheck method
Different distnces obviously, The race is ran to 10,000 So maybe move the X 1 space for every 500 miles and make 20 spaces.
Put these if statements after the part where it prints the distance, so at the end of the method



if (distance <500)
System.out.print("X-----------------|")

if (distance <1000)
System.out.print("-X----------------|")


if (distance <1500)
System.out.print("--X---------------|")
